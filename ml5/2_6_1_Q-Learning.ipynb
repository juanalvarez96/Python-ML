    "* **done (boolean):** whether it’s time to reset the environment again. Most (but not all) tasks are divided up into well-defined episodes, and done being True indicates the episode has terminated. (For example, perhaps the pole tipped too far, or you lost your last life.).\n",
    "* **info (dict):** diagnostic information useful for debugging. It can sometimes be useful for learning (for example, it might contain the raw probabilities behind the environment’s last state change). However, official evaluations of your agent are not allowed to use this for learning.\n",

    "The typical agent loop consists in first calling the method *reset* which provides an initial observation. Then the agent executes an action, and receives the reward, the new observation, and if the episode has finished (done is true). \n",
